---

## Load order

Typically:
- **Core**
- DLCs (if any)
- Other mods
- **RimWorld Hindi**

If another mod includes its own translation files, it may override parts of the Hindi text depending on load order.

---

## Known behavior

- Some UI strings are deliberately kept short to avoid overflow.
- Some mod-added content may remain in English unless those mods ship Hindi translations or you add patches.
- If you use many mods, translation completeness depends on whether those mods provide keyed strings / translation keys.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hindi isn’t showing up in the language menu”
- Confirm the mod is **enabled**
- Confirm the folder path is correct:
  - `Mods/RimWorld-Hindi/Languages/Hindi/`
- Restart RimWorld after enabling the mod

### “Some text is still in English”
- That text likely comes from:
  - another mod (no Hindi translation available)
  - newly added RimWorld content that hasn’t been updated yet
- Please open an issue with:
  - a screenshot
  - the exact English text
  - your mod list + load order (if possible)

### “Text looks weird / missing characters”
- RimWorld font rendering is sensitive to:
  - font mods
  - UI scaling
- Try disabling font/UI mods to confirm compatibility.
